# mini-hpc-manager

> Welcome to **Mini HPC Manager!** ðŸŽ‰

Mini HPC Manager is a simple tool designed to manage and execute jobs in HPC (High Performance Computing) and Cloud environments using Go and Docker. It provides a CLI for adding, listing, and running jobs with Docker containers.

## features

- Job Scheduling: Add jobs to a queue and specify their Docker images and commands.
- Database Integration: Stores job details and status using SQLite.
- Docker Integration: Handles job execution via Docker containers.
- Status Tracking: Updates and tracks job status (Pending, Running, Complete, Failed).
- Log Collection: Captures and stores job logs for review.
